# Collar

## Collar for Trello adds a button that hides Trello columns

Thanks to [fredericseiler's trelabels](https://github.com/fredericseiler/trelabels), from which I stole liberally.

Additional thanks to [Huboard](https://github.com/huboard/huboard-web) for having this feature from the get-go and inspiring me to add it to Trello.
